### Manual Setup

#### Backend Setup & Usage
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Set up environment variables (see backend/.env.example):
   - `GROQ_API_KEY` is **required**
   - `FIGMA_ACCESS_TOKEN` for Figma integration (optional but recommended)
   - If using OpenAI: set `OPENAI_API_KEY` too

3. Initialize the learning system:
   ```bash
   python setup_learning_system.py
   ```

4. Run the Flask server:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   - API will start at `http://localhost:8000`

#### Frontend Setup & Usage
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the Dev Server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   - UI available at `http://localhost:3000`
   - Modern responsive design with TailwindCSS
   - Real-time progress indicators and enhanced UX

## System Requirements

### Backend Dependencies
- **Python**: 3.8+ (with Python 3.10+ recommended)
- **Core Libraries**: Flask, ChromaDB, Sentence Transformers
- **AI/ML**: OpenAI API or Groq API access
- **Image Processing**: OpenCV, PIL, pytesseract (for OCR)

- **Vector Database**: ChromaDB with persistence

### Frontend Dependencies
- **Node.js**: 16+ (with Node.js 18+ recommended)
- **React**: 18.2+ with modern hooks and context
- **UI Framework**: TailwindCSS with custom components
- **Build Tools**: Create React App, PostCSS, Autoprefixer

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **ChromaDB Installation**: If ChromaDB fails to install, try using Python 3.10+
2. **OCR Dependencies**: Install tesseract on your system for image text extraction
3. **Figma Access**: Ensure your Figma token has proper permissions
4. **Memory Issues**: For large Figma files, increase system memory allocation

### Performance Optimization
- Use `requirements-minimal.txt` for basic functionality
